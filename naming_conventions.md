Hello Everyone,

As advised today in class, please follow below guidelines for assignment submission.

1. One document containing all screen shots. Convert it to pdf.

2. Second document with all your code.
Please paste the code in any notepad editor (e.g. notepad++) before your place it in the document to avoid dark backgrounds.
Please refrain from submitting screen shots of your code.
Convert the document to pdf.

3. If you have anything additional like some instruction on how to run your lab or additional notes, Please put it into third document. Convert it to pdf. This document is optional.

Please follow file naming conventions as belows.

1. <FirstNameInitial>_<FullLastName>_Lab1_screenshots.pdf
2. <FirstNameInitial>_<FullLastName>_Lab1_code.pdf
3. <FirstNameInitial>_<FullLastName>_Lab1_notes.pdf

Do not submit any file having size more than 10 MB. If there is a need please break it into additional files. Refer attachments for reference.

Also, you are more than welcome to do some additional stuff with your assignment like designing some nice UI, Put some additional validations or anything which you may feel should look good. Extra work will be appreciated. But please don't forget to meet all specifications and assignment grading criteria set by Prof. James.

My TA hours are not yet finalized. I will publish them soon. However you can contact me through email and I will try to help you with all your concerns.
